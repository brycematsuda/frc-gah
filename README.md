# frc-gah

Inspired by [this Facebook post on #moardata @ The Blue Alliance](https://www.facebook.com/groups/moardata/permalink/1094808283872799/), FRC GAH (Game Announcer Helper) is a small web application that uses The Blue Alliance's API ([via a Ruby port by Tyler 'chacha' Carter](https://github.com/chacha/thebluealliance-ruby)) to display team information for all six teams playing in each match at a competition. This saves time trying to read from a long list of teams on an Excel sheet or a physical piece of paper.

As this was thrown together in a few hours, the layout is pretty crude and the information is pretty basic (just team name, number, sponsors and location), but it can be improved to be nicer and include more detailed information, time permitting. Feel free to fork it and make your own additions.
